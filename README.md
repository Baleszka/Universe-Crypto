This is a useless Blockchain i made for no reason at all
You need to run server.py inside the Server folder and you can use it locally with the scripts from Wallet folder
If you want anyone to be able to use it you need to expose the port the server is running on and change all localhost:8000s to whatever domain you got
Have fun
